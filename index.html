    Arequipa is placed in the Southern Coastal region of Peru just below the edge of the Altiplano at 2335 meters 
    above sea level and surrounded by three impressive volcanoes.&nbsp; Arequipa is also known as The White City 
    (Ciudad Blanca) because of its many colonial-era Spanish buildings built of “sillar”, a pearly white volcanic 
    rock. The city is about an hour away by plane from Lima; about 35 minutes away of Cuzco by plane (close to 
    Machu Picchu) , about 8 hours by bus to Nazca lines (Ica city), and about 2 hours by plane to the amazon jungle ( Iquitos city ).
